# README

* Ruby version
For this project, I used Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.0.1.

* Database creation
Run "rails db:migrate" in the command line. (This step may not be necessary for the app to work.)

* How to run the test suite
Run "rails s" ('s' for "server") in the command line at the top of the project directory. Open a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000.

* About the app
This app is intended to be used as a simple blog posting app. The home page displays all existing posts with options to "Show," "Edit," and "Delete." Selecting "Show" will direct you to a separate page where you can comment on the selected post. Below the heading on the home page, there is also the option to create new posts.
